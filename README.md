# tellmesomethingnice
A tool to enrich internet environments with kindness

## development

### getting started

let's use [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), so preferably setup a virtual environment and install away...

```bash
# setup virtual env
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### running locally

just using standard django stuff for now

```bash
$ cd tellmesomethingnice
$ python manage.py runserver
```

## resources

lots of good Django resources including their docs:
* [Django](https://djangoproject.com), especially their Getting Started guids
* [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/skeleton_website)
